I have worked for: *[Vidhi](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/)* (2022-present), *[Dialogue](https://thedialogue.co.in/)* (2020), and private clients (2021-). I've interned with: *[Supreme Court Observer](https://scobserver.in/)*, a retired Supreme Court Justice, an Advocate General, and other lawyers. Everything here should be considered my own opinion, taken at my risk, and not attributable to my past or present employers. I also write for the *[Leaflet](https://theleaflet.in/)* and *[PULJ](https://pulj.org/)*.

I have spent a good deal of time mourning the fact that the blog --- distributed via RSS and consumed by avid readers --- is slowly becoming a historical artefact. Well, them's the breaks.

If you'd like to explore working with me as a collaborator or as a consultant -- feel free to drop an [email](mailto:iamnihalsahu@gmail.com) or message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/annihalated).
