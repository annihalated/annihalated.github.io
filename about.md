I'm [Nihal Sahu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nihal-sahu/). I'm a writer and researcher currently living in Kochi, Kerala. I grew up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. I am a law student at the National University of Advanced Legal Studies.

Things I'm Involved with and areas of interest:

-   **Policy.** As of June 2022, I'm a research associate at the [Vidhi Center for Legal Policy](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/), with the Health team.
-   **Writing.** I'm writing on my substack, [Arguable](https://arguable.substack.com/), and trying my best to become a more productive writer without compromising on quality. I also spend a small percentage of my time writing for other great publications like the [Leaflet](https://theleaflet.in/author/nihal-sahu/).
-   **Litigation.** I spend some of my time assisting a lawyer at the Kerala High Court, focused on public law issues. For some reason, I like courts.

Previously, in reverse chronological order

-   I spent a few months interning at [The Dialogue](https://thedialogue.co/), working on public health and digital systems. This was extremely useful work, since it was my first exposure to excellent researchers working in a thoroughly professional environment.
-   I was a senior editor and managing editor of the blog at my law school's [flagship journal.](https://nualslawjournal.com/)

In my free time I read weird blogs, ride the Kochi metro, and go on runs.

#### Why do you blog?

To quote [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/):

> Mostly for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of software development over time -- whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.
