I am a writer and researcher. I work on constitutional law, religious freedom, public health, and pharmaceutical regulation. I'm also a hobbyist programmer and love fiddling with this website as a way to keep myself reading academic papers most of the time. I also spend a good bit of time hanging around the Kerala High Court, drafting writ petitions and counter affidavits, and generally enjoying myself.

I have worked for: [*Vidhi*](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) (2022-present), [*Dialogue*](https://thedialogue.co.in) (2020), and private clients (2021-). I've interned with: [*Supreme Court Observer*](https://scobserver.in), a retired Supreme Court Justice, an Advocate General, and other lawyers. Everything here should be considered my own opinion, taken at my risk, and not attributable to my past or present employers. I also write for the [*Leaflet*](https://theleaflet.in) and [*PULJ*](https://pulj.org). 

I publish a newsletter on [Substack](https://nihalsahu.substack.com), which is functionally my blog. I have spent a good deal of time mourning the fact that the blog --- distributed via RSS and consumed by avid readers --- is slowly becoming a historical artefact. Well, them's the breaks. For an explanation of why this site exists, see the [*About*](/about) page.
