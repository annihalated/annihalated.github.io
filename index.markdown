I am a writer and researcher. I work on constitutional law, religious freedom, public health, and pharmaceutical regulation. I'm also a hobbyist programmer and love fiddling with this website as a way to keep myself reading academic papers most of the time. I have worked for, published in, consulted for, or interned at: [*Vidhi*](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) (2022-present), [*Dialogue*](https://thedialogue.co.in) (2020), and private clients (2021-); everything here should be considered my own opinion, taken at my risk, and not attributable to my past or present employers. I also publish a newsletter on [Substack](https://nihalsahu.substack.com).
