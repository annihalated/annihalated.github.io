Senior Counsels before High Courts and the Supreme Court charge anywhere between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 10+ Lakh per hearing. Why? 

The answer is structural. The Indian Supreme Court, which currently has 70,000 cases pending before it, only has 34 judges, who sit in panels of two and three. This frankly impossible task is possible (even as a moonshot), because the Court doesn’t hear all 70,000 at length. Instead, there’s something called an admission day, on which lawyers line up in a fashion more akin to a bazaar than a temple of justice, and try to convince the judge to get the case admitted for regular hearing. When you have fifty lawyers trying to sidle up to you and mention individual and complex legal disputes, you are more likely to listen more carefully to lawyers you know and trust. 

The famous senior lawyers of India have that distinction - they are *trusted* - they even have different outfits. If they show up on admissions day, the case is significantly more likely to be listed. And so, if you want your case heard quickly, i.e. you want to cut in line, you hire a Senior Counsel, whose face and voice alone merit a hearing.  This is not a guess - there’s data. Tarunabh Khaitan, in his [empirical study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24730580.2020.1730543) of the Supreme Court’s docket, found that: 

> the presence of a senior advocate (representing either party) during an admission hearing has a statistically significant, positive, relationship with the likelihood of the case being admitted for a regular hearing; and that it is a bad predictor for the likelihood of eventual success of the case.

Think about lakhs of rupees per appearance. In the surrealist world of Indian courts, you are not paying just for skill and advocacy - you are paying for the chance to have your case heard properly in the first place. Even in regular hearings, courts will bear with senior counsels more, will tolerate wilder arguments, will hear them longer, and will take what they have to say more seriously. Because they are “stalwarts of the bar.” Because they are “the giants of the profession.” But they are these things because the judges know them. Because they are friends. Because they grew up in similar environments, and in some cases, were classmates. The more closed the system, the more nepotistic it is, the higher the returns to familiarity with judges. And Indian law is a system unparalleled for its reliance on power networks, on phone calls, and on friendships. 

And those things are worth a lot of money.
