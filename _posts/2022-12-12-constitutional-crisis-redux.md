title: Constitutional Crisis Redux
excerpt: "What does the Election Commission Appointments Case (2022) and the Collegium Case (1993) have in common? The answer has a lot to do with the separation of powers, human nature, and what happens when people don't listen to courts."

> *-- Someone smart*

The Supreme Court has finished hearing and reserved judgment in *Anoop Baranwal v Union of India*. Here's a summary from SCObserver:

> In January 2015, Anoop Baranwal filed a PIL on the ground that the current system for appointing members of the Election Commission of India (ECI) is unconstitutional. Currently, the Executive enjoys the power to make appointments, which the PIL contends has degraded the ECI's independence over time. The PIL pleads for the Court to issue directions to set up an independent, Collegium-like system for ECI appointments. It claims that the current system of appointments violates Article 324(2) of the Constitution.

I can feel the Union Government getting institutional-memory PTSD from the *Three Judges' cases* and the *NJAC* case already.  During the hearings, Attorney-General Venkataramani and Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta  argued that any such direction would be an unprecedented violation of the rights of the Executive. The Attorney-General's general tone was one of deferential, but persistent pushback.

Here's [LiveLaw](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-constitution-bench-eci-election-commissioner-appointment-neutral-body-214768) on the hearings of 22nd November:

> Attorney General for India Senior Advocate R Venkatramani, appearing for the Union of India, started his submissions on Tuesday by first delving into the role of Constitutional Courts across the world. He then came to discuss the powers of Constitutional Courts India and their inherent limitations based on the Montesquian principle of Separation of Powers which is also a part of the Indian Constitutional Scheme.

At this point, Justice Joseph interrupted the AG and said that the bench wanted to point out two aspects to him before proceeding with his submissions.

> Pointing out the first aspect Justice Joseph said, "The phenomenon is that from 2007 till now CEC's have had very short tenures. Around 2 years and many even less than that. The question is this. Under the 1991 Act the term of CEC used to be 6 years. However, the proviso said that if he attains 65 years of age, he would retire before the completion of that period. So, what the government has been doing is that because it knows the DOB, it ensures that one who is appointed does not get his full 6 years. So, the independence gets thwarted here. We want answers on this from you. Now, CEC's are not getting their full terms. How will they carry out their tasks? This trend has continued. I did the math there also. Be it UPA govt or this govt."

Forgive me, but 'I did the math' is a political and policy view, and not a constitutional or legal one. Fair, good, you may be right, but then again, 'where's the law?' asks the Attorney-General:

> The AG replied to the above by stating that the Court will have to understand the way the Authority perceives its duty. He further pointed out "One set principle is that the original feature of the Constitution cannot be challenged. Matters that are open for scrutiny by this court are ones that violate fundamental rights. The court can enhance the provision but when it comes to striking an original provision of the Constitution, that is for parliament to debate and not the court... That distinction needs to be finely understood."

And the Court waved this away, somewhat dismissively, and started roleplaying as the Constituent Assembly: 

> At this point the bench started to contemplate on how the appointment should actually take place for the best man to be appointed as the Election Commissioner. Justice Joseph remarked, "You see apart from competence, what is important is you need someone with character. Who does not allow himself to be bulldozed. So the point is who will appoint this person. The least intrusive is that there is a system when there is a presence of the Chief Justice in the appointment committee. We feel that his very presence will be a message that no mess up will happen. We need the best man. And there shouldn't be any disagreement on that. Even judges have prejudices. But, at least you can expect that there will be neutrality."

Amusing, to be sure, and as self-assured as you will ever see a judicial branch get. '*Even judges have prejudices?'* And pretty much nobody in the Bar thought this comment merited at least an op-ed? To say that you want someone who is 'above politics' in a political conflict regarding appointments, and then to suggest the Chief Justice, is like saying, 'I want a philosopher king, and I think that's my best friend.' *This is literally politics*. 

On [23rd November](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-eci-election-commissioner-cec-appointment-neutral-body-214870), the riposte came --- Federalist Papers Redux, courtesy of the Solicitor-General:

> Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Union also submitted before the court and said "In Article 324 there is a function and that has to be exercised by the President unless Parliament gives it to some other authority according to 53(3)(b). There is a system of separation of powers. Now one cannot get into one another's powers."
>
> On the question of inclusion of CJI in the appointing process, Mr. Mehta submitted, "There is an impression which has been made out that some outsider's presence has to be in the appointing body who is not a part of the executive. That will mean rewriting the Constitution. That will mean conferring someone else with power because the executive cannot dispense a function which has been conferred upon it. That is against the very concept of democracy."
>
> At this point, Justice Joseph intervened and said, "CJI is involved in the appointment of CBI director. Where is the threat to democracy there? Our courts have given judgments and that has been accepted by the Executive."
>
> Mr. Mehta further pointed out, "As a constitutional proposition, the executive independence and the judiciary's independence are equally sacrosanct. The doctrine of separation of powers stems from Article 14 - all three organs are equal in the eyes of the Constitution. In a presupposition that only with the presence of the judiciary, independence and fairness will be achieved, that is an incorrect reading of the constitution. Mere presence of someone from judiciary will ensure transparency is wrong reading and fallacious. If there is need of law then your lordships can suggest to the Parliament. Court cannot issue mandamus. Court can't do something that the Parliament is supposed to. In the absence of a law, the court can't say this is the law and so therefore you follow it until there is law."

I can't believe I'm saying this, but the Solicitor-General is correct.

During the proceedings, one of the members of the bench said 'we do not want this to be adversarial'. Most of the time, when there's a conflict between the Executive and the Judiciary, both try very hard to make it not seem like a conflict. One way it does this is by saying "oh we are not trying to make this adversarial", which, in an adversarial system, is code for "we want you to start listening to what we say, this is not a dispute, this is a situation and we are taking charge."

But that's very weird and very India-specific because it is very rarely that courts are "taking charge" of a matter of public law, or anything. This is a very Indian way of doing things. In most jurisdictions, and indeed, in most courts, you can have various disputes of procedural rights at various stages, and you can have serious disagreements about whether this interim order or that direction from the court is legally sanctioned. But in India, when the feces hit the fan, as they might in a pandemic, or with a domineering Executive, the Court just goes (if it has the political capital): "Okay, you are all insane, let me give this a try" and plays a role in governance. It's sort of like saying "all of you just shut up and listen to me."

Let's hypothetically assume that the Court rules in favor of the petitioners in *ECI Appointments* in a way that directly involves the judiciary in the appointment process. Of course, this is very clearly a classic separation of powers concern. And we have ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, a ballgame.

This has happened before.

# The Judges Cases


Article 124 of the Constitution of India lays down the procedure for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court. 

> Article 124: (1) There shall be a Supreme Court of India constituting of a Chief Justice of India and, until Parliament by law prescribes a larger number, of not more than seven other Judges
>
> **(2) Every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President** by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty five years: Provided that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the chief Justice, the chief Justice of India shall always be consulted:

But reading the text does not help you at all in this area of constitutional law. If you read the constitution, you would have a factually inaccurate view of how judges of the Supreme Court are appointed. Contrary to a more cynical perspective, this is not *actually* how most law works. Reading the text should get you an *idea* of how the institution described in the text works. 

The reason for this radical disconnect between text and reality is three Supreme Court judgments known as the [*Three Judges' cases*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Judges_Cases). These are long judgments, and describing them here is tiresome, so here is the upshot. The cases, roughly, revolved around how judges are appointed, and particularly, on what Article 124 means when it says that the President of India has to 'consult' with 'such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the State as the President may deem necessary for the purpose'. 

In the first case (SP Gupta v. President of India), the Court made a number of observations about the term 'consultation.' Roughly, consultation would have to be 'meaningful, purposeful, result oriented and of substance.' No individual judges' opinion, including the Chief Justice's could have undue weight or primacy. But overall, the Court affirmed that 'the power to make judicial appointments lay with the Executive, and that the Chief Justice's recommendations, or anyone else's, for that matter, would not be binding on the executive.'

But as 'political control at the centre weakened in the late 1980s, the judiciary sought to wrest control of its composition from the executive.' And in the *Second Judges' Case (SCAOR v Union of India)*, the Court partly overruled the *First Judges Case,* 'creatively reinterpreted' the word 'consultation' in Article 124 to mean 'concurrence', and established the 'primacy of the judiciary' in cases of gridlock. In short, recommendations as to the appointment of judges are made by the Chief Justice and the two senior-most judges. These recommendations *bind* the Executive. This is the collegium.

The Third *Judges'* case is not a dispute at all, but an advisory opinion requested from the Court by the President of India. In that case, the Court held that the CJI should consult with the *four* senior-most judges, expanding the size of the group making the recommendations. The collegium becomes bigger.

In 2016, the Union Government tried to overturn the *Judges cases* and replace the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), amending the Constitution and getting rid of the 'consultation' text entirely. This was something of a concession, as both the judiciary and the Executive would be part of the process, with the latter having theoretical precedence (because of the composition of the Commission).

The Court struck down NJAC constitutional amendment too, stating that the independence of the judiciary, which was part of the basic structure of the Constitution, required the *primacy* of the judiciary in cases of breaking deadlock as far as judicial appointments are concerned. 

# Separation of Powers

Understandably, this procedure still bothers the Executive. In his maiden Rajya Sabha speech, the Vice-President of India made [the following remarks](https://thewire.in/government/jagdeep-dhankhar-supreme-court-njac-rajya-sabha) about the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), which was held unconstitutional in 2016:

> "The Indian Parliament, in 2015-216, was dealing with a Constitutional amendment Act and, as a matter of record, the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously. There was no abstention and no dissension. And the amendment was passed. In Rajya Sabha, it was unanimous, there was one abstention. We, the people -- their ordainment was converted into a constitutional provision. The power of the people came to be reflected... on a legitimate platform through applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance."

Here's the tweet and video:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The historic NJAC Bill, passed unanimously by the Parliament, was undone by the Supreme Court using the judicially evolved doctrine of &#39;Basic Structure&#39; of Constitution.<br><br>There is no parallel to such a development in democratic history of the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RajyaSabha?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RajyaSabha</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WinterSession?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WinterSession</a> <a href="https://t.co/54BdgLSs3e">pic.twitter.com/54BdgLSs3e</a></p>&mdash; Vice President of India (@VPSecretariat) <a href="https://twitter.com/VPSecretariat/status/1600446170274594816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The criticism goes likes this: this is a system where judges appoint judges, this is judicial overreach, this is activism, etc. But in reality, this judicial primacy is tempered by the fact that the Union sits on recommendations it does not like pretty much indefinitely, and can frustrate the process quite effectively. The actual process goes something like this:

1. The Collegium sends names to the Government
2. The Government either accepts them, sends them back for reconsideration, or sits on them, and maybe sends them back after a long time
3. If it doesn't get accepted, the Court gets angry?

Needless to say, this process is not ideal. But it's the one that exists.

And here's more recent drama, as summarised in an Indian Express editorial:

> The Supreme Court has gently, yet firmly, spoken its mind on the recent remarks by Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on the Collegium system that decides on the appointment of judges. In a recent interview, Rijiju, who described the Collegium system as "alien" to the Constitution, said, "Never say that the government is sitting on the files, then don't send the files to the government, you appoint yourself, you run the show." Justice S K Kaul's response to this petulant framing of the matter as a Court versus government faceoff was measured: "It came from somebody high. Should not have. All I can say is, it should not have happened."

# Some theory

The *intention* of the separation of powers goes something like this. You want to avoid autocracy. Because autocracy means unchecked power, which leads to abuses of power. What is *too* powerful is sort of hard to define, but generally it is agreed that the more diffuse the power, the more tenuous its ability of bad actors to pool and coagulate it, to concentrate it into autocracy. 

The *theory* of the separation of powers goes something like this. You split the power up. Let's start with the notion, at least in a modern nation state, that the state is the repository of all power. State power, in a primal, regal way, is unitary (/ˈjuːnɪt(ə)ri/, adjective, forming a single or uniform entity) and not diffuse. Subject to its ability to coerce obedience and inspire allegiance, it is final. 

And so you split this power up, into different branches of government. While it is common for this to be in the tripartite system (legislative, judiciary, executive), this is hardly necessary, and they could be split into any number of branches. 

But all of this would have been very, very pointless if *in reality* these systems did not have the ability to counteract the other. Hamilton put it well, in Federalist No. 51, when he said that "the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others." 

In other words, the separation of powers cannot be merely a legal separation between different departments. At the end of the day, the process of elite negotiation is a fight for a knife in the mud; you have to keep in mind that these are *people* who hold these powers, and their personal motives must be aligned with the motives of their office and the public good. 

# Some analysis

There are roughly three ways you can read the development of the collegium system. 

**First**, you can say that faced with continuous threats to its independence from the executive branch, the judiciary responded with a groundbreaking judgment that creatively interpreted the text of Article 124 to create a better system. 

**Second**, you could say that the courts conducted a power grab under circumstances of duress, exploiting weak coalition governments that could not overturn the collegium system. 

**Third**, you could say that parts of both hypotheses were true: *it was a power grab*, but it was with good purpose and faced with an existential threat. 

If the Court rules for the Petitioner in the ECI appointments in a manner that involves the judiciary directly, you would have to say one of these three.
