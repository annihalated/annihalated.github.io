title: "Religion and the Courts"

In the previous essay, we noted that the individual right to religious freedom meant the right to "believe, profess, practice, and propagate" your religion. These are four *distinct* components and it's worth unpacking them. The right to *believe*, referred to as "freedom of conscience" is a sort of vague right -- it refers both to the freedom of religion, but generally, it refers to the right to freely hold beliefs. The right to *profess* that religious belief allows you to *manifest* that belief. In India, the state cannot prevent you from saying "I am a Hindu/Muslim/Christian (etc.), and I believe in the following god(s) and/or holy book(s)." The right to *practice* means that you can go to your temples, recite devotional poetry, be a whirling dervish, do the namaz, or go to a church in India without hindrance. And the right to *propagate* means that you can spread your religion's message, conduct seminars, and argue various things.

In other words, understand that there are negative rights ("A has a right to do X act; the state may not make a law preventing him from doing X act") and positive rights ("A has a right to X; the state must ensure that he gets X"). There are also vertical rights ("A has the right to do X; the State may not prevent him from doing X")  and horizontal rights ("No one can prevent him from doing X"). A vertical right of free expression stops the government from preventing your speech, while a horizontal right stops your employer  from preventing your speech.

The Court
=========

You might assume, having read [*Religious Freedom, Reform, and Secularism*](https://nihalsahu.net/law-and-religion-in-india), that the state is the primary actor in most religious disputes. And the state's a major player. No one denies that. But the body most accused of interfering in religious affairs is the Supreme Court of India. 

Since 1950, the Court has interfered authoritatively and persistently in religious affairs. In 2017, it held that 'triple talaq' was not part of Islam. In 2018, it held that women of menstrual age could enter the Sabarimala temple. 

However, this is not really the problem. Courts administer all sorts of disputes, and there's no reason why they can't resolve disputes that happen to be in a religious context. But the Supreme Court of India doesn't just resolve disputes that have a religious context. They decide issues of religious substance. They have evolved service law for priests and evidentiary tests about scriptures. 

Types of restrictions
=====================

When the state tries to interfere with a religious practice, they generally do it in one of three ways. 
1. **Direct prohibition.** Some laws directly ban a religious practice. The provision would read something like: 'No person shall pray to the Cookie Monster.' There aren't really many of these laws around, and they generally cause something of an uproar when they're passed. For example, in February 2022, the Karnataka Government [banned](https://www.scobserver.in/journal/karnataka-government-order-on-dress-code-for-students/) students from 'wearing a hijab in State educational institutions that had prescribed a dress code,' resulting in general polarisation, multiple rounds of litigation, peaceful protests, violent protests, and a breakdown of law and order.

2. **Neutral rules**. More commonly, the law prohibits something general that happen to be part of a religious practice. Amanpreet is a Sikh boy in eighth grade and his religion commands that he carry a ceremonial dagger, the kirpan. However, Acme High School has a neutral rule which says "no knives allowed." Amanpreet goes to court and says 'I understand that there is a good reason not to have daggers in the classroom, but my dagger is ceremonial and can't hurt anyone. I claim an exception to this neutral rule, as it does not impose a major burden on you, and because I have a right to my religious practices.' Amanpreet need not even prove that wearing the kirpan is part of his religion, because the Constitution comes right out and says so. (See Article 25, Explanation I: "The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.)

3. **Facially neutral rules directed at a religious practice.** Let's assume John is a member of the sect (or religious denomination) of Ananda Marg, part of whose practices include performing the Tandava dance. The Tandava dance may look scary to the non-practitioner. It involves holding a dagger in one hand, a human skull in the other, and kicking your legs upward. However, the Commissioner of Police in Calcutta has been repeatedly issuing a [Section 144](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/930621/) order, which says that "no member of a procession  or assembly  of five  or more  persons  should carry any  fire arms,  explosives, swords,  spears, knives, tridents, lathis  or any article which may be used as weapon of offence  or any  article likely to cause annoyance to the public, for example, skulls."

When I read the order, I thought I was going crazy. But no, the order really said 'you know, by the way, for example, skulls.' Either Calcutta had a general 'people walking around with skulls' problem or this facially neutral provision was directed at the Tandava dance. Not particularly subtle, Mr. Commissioner.

Now, the Commissioner of Police didn't tell John that the Tandava dance was prohibited. You just couldn't walk around in a group with skulls and knives. The Commissioner instituted a facially neutral prohibition which was nonetheless directed at the religious practice of a particular denomination. John goes to court, and says "Your honour, I am an Ananda Margi, and this practice is part of my religion. The Commissioner's neutral-seeming rule was directed at my religious denomination's practices and is discriminatory, and even if that were not the case, I seek enforcement of my fundamental right to practise my religion." [See Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta and Anr., AIR 1984 SC 512].

The role of the court
=====================

You want to do something in pursuit of your religious beliefs, and the state prohibits that thing. You go to court and assert your fundamental right to φ under the right to religious freedom.  [Note: φ is the symbol for the Greek letter Phi, and in philosophy, it indicates a generic act.]

Completely separate from this, denominations and sects of religions sometimes sue the state claiming interference in 'matters of religion.' (Article 26) The question now is the meaning of 'interference.' What can it possibly mean, if states literally control the finances of temples, set guidelines as to who can be a priest, and decide which language the prayers are to take place in?
There's also a third category of parties that show up in disputes. Sometimes, the state isn't limiting your religious freedom -- your community is doing it instead. What happens when the right to individual religious freedom contradicts the right of the religious denomination to manage their own affairs 'in matters of religion.' The parties here are not individual/group v. state, but individual/subset v. group. This is sometimes called an internal dispute.

As Bhatia states the question [in his paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-constitutionalism/article/abs/freedom-from-community-individual-rights-group-life-state-authority-and-religious-freedom-under-the-indian-constitution/6BC323DA5683AC163A15B85A173A8DC6), 'in what manner should a Constitution that guarantees the freedom of religion to both individuals and communities, mediate the claims of religious groups against the claims of their constituents?'

Take Sabarimala, for example, where a piece of legislation said that customary restrictions on entry into Sabarimala temple would be maintained. The custom in question was a prohibition on the entry of women of a menstrual age into the temple. Women, or at least those who purported to speak for them, initiated a public interest litigation before the Supreme Court of India.
