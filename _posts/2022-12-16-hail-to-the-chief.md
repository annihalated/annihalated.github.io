title: Hail to the Chief
excerpt: Being Chief Justice of India is all about tradeoffs. And D.Y. Chandrachud has so many tradeoffs to think about. So, so many. Also ft. Attorney-General Venkataramani calling the Chief Justice an anointed king.

*Important disclaimer: I am not a judge of the Supreme Court of India. And therefore, of course, what do I know?*

* * * * *

It has been roughly three weeks since [DY Chandrachud](https://www.scobserver.in/judges/d-y-chandrachud/) took office as the Chief Justice of India. Chandrachud is widely expected to be a liberal and progressive Chief Justice, and he is expected to serve for about two years, until November 10, 2024. His father, YV Chandrachud, was also the Chief Justice of India. While this is the first time both a father and a son have run the judicial branch, there are plenty of other examples of people related to each other in the Supreme Court. CJI M.H. Kania (1991-92) was the nephew of CJI H.J. Kania, the first Chief Justice of India. The late Justice K.K. Matthew is the father of Justice K.M Joseph, both of the Supreme Court. Chief Justice PN Bhagwati was the son of Justice Bhagwati, a former Supreme Court judge.

## Weird Parades
This Chief Justice has, through much of his judicial career, talked about the illusion of merit, the evils of a feudal and servile mentality, and the centrality of a tradition of democratization and accountability. He has presented himself, at all times, as a man deeply committed to defeating 'colonial structures' and is an enemy of [unearned 'privilege'](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/justice-dy-chandrachud-caste-privilege-caste-discrimination-dr-ambedkar-187082). Given all of this, I had imagined that everyone would try, as much as possible, not to draw attention to the slightly nepotistic undertone that is a feature of all Indian institutions.

*Boy, was I wrong!* Instead of the muted image of orderly succession, we got an extravaganza of it. Here's ex-Chief Justice Lalit, who has had an [exceptional term](https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2022/11/07/the-freedom-of-one-single-human-spirit-on-the-legacy-of-chief-justice-uu-lalit/), as he handed over power to his successor, describing how his first appearance before the Supreme Court was to mentioning a case before Chief Justice YV Chandrachud:

> "My journey began in this Court, and today it again ends from this Court. The person before whom I mentioned the matter, he passed on the baton to successive Chief Justices, and it was my great fortune to recieve that baton, and which I will now be passing on to a very distinguished member and the *son* *of that man.* I couldn't have asked for anything greater than that.*"*

Uh, I have very little to say except that this is cute. The method by which judges are chosen in India has to be judged against the likely alternative --- a court packed by the Executive --- and so I am a little less hardline on this than I might otherwise be. Fine, nepotism is a problem in Indian politics as well as Indian law. This is like, bad. But we happen to be a unique fairyland jurisdiction where an astrological chart, a list of your lineal ascendants, and the All India Seniority List can tell you more about your prospects of becoming a judge of a constitutional court than literally any other factor, and that's simply the world we live in. 

But you can like, not make it weird! And the *Bar* -- the lawyers -- took it upon themselves to *make it weird*. Hark, here comes the Attorney-General at a felicitation function --- perhaps we can expect some classical restraint:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Attorney-General R Venkataramani says, &quot;I am delighted to witness a veritable coronation ceremony. In a coronation ceremony, the king is not only crowned, then follows other investiture of regalia. You witnessed all that today.&quot;<br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SupremeCourt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SupremeCourt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/sF1qlCELtC">pic.twitter.com/sF1qlCELtC</a></p>&mdash; Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1593954770548822016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Ahahaha, as the principal law officer, you may think to say many things while introducing a Chief Justice of India who happens to be the son of another Chief Justice of India. But perhaps you might not want to start by calling the event a *coronation.*"Damn it!" thought a publicist, and proceeded to commit seppuku, though more out of professional commitment than a fear of consequences. 

Levers
------

If you're the Chief Justice, you have a few levers of power.

**First**, you have soft power; a bully pulpit of sorts. You can make speeches at Universities and Bar Associations and all sorts of events and try to signal attitudes to other judicial officers and lawyers. In some tenures, this is literally all that happens.

**Second**, you are the *master of the roster*, which means that you have final control over the constitution of benches of the Supreme Court --- you get to decide which judges get which kinds of cases.

**Third**, you run the Collegium, where, with other senior judges, you make (theoretically binding) recommendations for the appointment of other judges. This power is heavily qualified, in practice, by the fact that the Executive can delay, and generally defeat you by sitting on the appointments. The judicial branch, as Hamilton said, has neither sword nor purse, neither force nor will, but merely judgment. (This is not *generally* true of the Indian Supreme Court, but in this case it makes a useful point.)

**Fourth**, you are, in a way, a CEO of the Supreme Court's processes. You can make technological innovations and improve procedures, etc.

**Fifth**, you are, of course, a judge of the Supreme Court and you can decide cases and write great judgments if you are so inclined.

## Tradeoffs, Tradeoffs, Tradeoffs

You will use these powers to achieve a number of objectives. CJIs have many priorities on their plates, but any list of the factors that define a legacy are:

(1) his general popularity at the time he leaves office;

(2) his contributions to the development of the law;

(3) his ability to maintain the independence of the judiciary and keep a patchwork simulation of the rule of law going;

(4) his administrative efforts, which are primarily directed towards two complementary goals, which are (a) the appointment of judges to fill the many vacancies in India's judiciary and (b) reducing the [gargantuan](https://theleaflet.in/the-debate-around-pendency-in-the-supreme-court-needs-a-dash-of-empiricism/) number of pending cases before the Supreme Court and the High Courts.

By now, you will probably have noticed that (3) and (4) are somewhat contradictory. If you want to appoint more judges and improve the legal system, you need the Executive's help. And if you write great judgments that expand the rights of citizens and constrain the powers of the Executive, you will annoy the Executive.

And so you will compromise on one or the other, or you will compromise on both ends. I don't mean "compromise" here as a naked compromise, but merely that these are factors that go into making the sausage that is a functioning legal order. There are structural contradictions at the heart of the role, and it makes it very difficult to be both a *popular* and an *effective* Chief Justice.
