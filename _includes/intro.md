I'm Nihal Sahu. 

The common theme in my work is trying to understand the structural, ideological, and personal factors that govern the behaviour of policymakers and judges.

I try not to negatively characterize or attribute malice to anyone, and I try to remember that these people did not wake up in the morning with the intention of doing evil. If φ-ing will improve consistency in the legal system, cause the economy to grow faster, or improve administrative efficiency, why don’t policymakers φ? They must have *some* reason. They *want* the economy to grow faster. 

My critical skills are law, writing, research, project management, and software. In a different life, I wrote a lot of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week to help with my research. 

These days, I'm working at [Vidhi](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own.
