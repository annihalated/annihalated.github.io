I'm Nihal Sahu. 

The common theme in my work is trying to understand the structural, ideological, and personal factors that govern the behaviour of policymakers and judges.

In answering this question, I try not to negatively characterize or attribute malice to anyone, and I try to remember that these people did not wake up in the morning with the intention of doing evil. If φ-ing will improve consistency in the legal system, cause the economy to grow faster, or improve administrative efficiency, why don’t policymakers φ? They must have *some* reason. They *want* the economy to grow faster. 

These days, I'm working at [Vidhi](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own. 

I have about {% posts_word_count total %} words for you to read just on this website. There are plenty more, and you can find them here.
