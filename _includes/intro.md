I'm Nihal Sahu. 

You might know me as the only software guy on the legal team. In a different life, I wrote a _lot_ of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week.

Most of the time, I am reading and writing about Indian law and policy. 

**If you had to know one thing about me:** I am *extremely* driven in the pursuit of understanding why policymakers and judges do the things that they do. In a sense, understanding this is my primary mission. The Lucas question is “Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia’s or Egypt’s?” The question I would ask instead is this *“If there is some action a government of India can take that would lead the Indian economy to grow faster, why don’t Indian policymakers take that action? Surely, they want the Indian economy to grow faster.”*

I believe that it is pointless to characterize some entity as  “neoliberal scum”, “evil banksters”, “anti-national protestors”, “apathetic bureaucrats”, or “a symptom of the savagery that is late capitalism,” without the underlying caveat that those people did not wake up in the morning with the intention of doing evil. There is far less evil out there than you think, and it’s usually not where you expect it to be found. Consequently, I also lean towards being extremely non-judgmental and anti-outrage (with some exceptions).

These days, I'm working at [Vidhi](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own. 

I have about {% posts_word_count total %} words for you to read just on this website. There are plenty more, and you can find them here.
