I'm Nihal Sahu. I produce well-researched writing on law, courts, and governments.

You might know me as the only software guy on the legal team. In a different life, I wrote a _lot_ of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week.

I publish a newsletter on [Substack](https://nihalsahu.substack.com/), which is functionally my blog. I have spent a good deal of time mourning the fact that the blog - distributed via RSS and consumed by avid readers - is slowly becoming a historical artefact. Well, them's the breaks. For an explanation of why this site exists, see the [About](https://nihalsahu.net/about) page.
