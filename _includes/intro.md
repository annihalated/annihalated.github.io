I'm Nihal Sahu. I produce well-researched writing on law, courts, and governments.

You might know me as the only software guy on the legal team. In a different life, I wrote a _lot_ of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week.

These days, I'm working at [Vidhi](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own.
