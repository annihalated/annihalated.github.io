I am a writer and researcher. I have worked for, published in, consulted for, or interned at: [*Vidhi*](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in) (2022-present), [*Dialogue*](https://thedialogue.co.in) (2020), and private clients (2021-); everything here should be considered my own opinion, taken at my risk, and not attributable to my past or present employers. I also publish a newsletter on [Substack](https://nihalsahu.substack.com).

During law school (2018-2023), I was a Managing Editor (Blog) and Senior Editor at my law school's [flagship journal.](https://nualslawjournal.com/)


## Forms and Functions

This isn't quite a blog. Well, the general impulse is blog-adjacent, but it breaks convention by failing to publish in discrete, completed units. This website will contain plenty of material that is *in-progress*. I hope to slowly develop a habit of writing into a pepetually-open text file, documenting ideas and thoughts from research papers, blog posts, and other materials.

[Gwern](https://gwern.net), as usual, articulates this motivation best: 
> My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally or too tedious. (Conscientiousness is often lacking online or in volunteer communities and many useful things go undone.) Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself. (Even experienced professionals can only write at their peak for a few hours a day—usually first thing in the morning it seems.) Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to time. And the rest takes care of itself. 

This is helpful if your sole objective, like Gwern, is to build a library of Alexandria on the internet. Some mortals are not so lucky. Instead, I have to produce journal articles, reports, white papers, individual research notes, and all sorts of [grey literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature), which live on Google Docs, and later, as PDFs. My main workflow challenge is to reasonably divide my time between focused professional output and [learning in public](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog).

## Workflow

I occasionally get overwhelmed by commitments, and enter a vague twilight-zone state of anxiety over not having everything filed away perfectly, perhaps in a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system. I invariably come to my senses a few hours later, but by then, I will have created multiple Notion databases, downloaded and deleted Obsidian for the twentieth time or so, and impulse shopped for notebooks from Moleskine. This is devastating to my plans for that evening, which are probably something fairly pedestrian, like reading a paper.
