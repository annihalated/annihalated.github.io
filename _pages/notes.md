## Life advice

> "Much meaningful activity is prevented by the aversive aura around brief awkward conversations like these. And even making simple changes in your environment comes with a small moment of humiliation. Hiring a personal trainer, if you have the money to do that, means confronting the fact that you need an appreciative audience for your muscle growth. Installing Cold Turkey to limit your time on Twitter requires admitting to yourself that you’re not in control, that thousands of years of evolution have not prepared you for Jack Dorsey’s mind manipulation techniques." 

*Sasha Chapin*, [Self-Improvement Is, Generally, a Lie](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/self-improvement-is-generally-a-lie)

> "I'm starting to think that procrastination by reading random articles does not cause you to rest, that is, you do not regain mental energy from it.  Success and happiness cause you to regain willpower; what you need to heal your mind from any damage sustained by working is not inactivity, but reliably solvable problems which reliably deliver experienced jolts of positive reinforcement.  Putting in the effort to read a good book may do this; playing a good computer game may do this; reading random Internet articles, or playing bad games, probably won't.  Literal mental exhaustion might mean that you don't have enough energy left to read a good book - or that you don't have enough energy left to pay the immediate cost of searching your library for good reading material instead of mediocre reading material - but in this case you shouldn't be reading random online articles.  You should be sitting with your eyes closed listening to music, or possibly even napping; if dealing with a truly exhausted brain, reading random articles is probably too much effort."

## New Labour

Recently, I've been obsessed with reading and watching stuff about [New Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Labour). 

1. [Emerging from the Penumbra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6HFs8pzuZM) (originally aired in 1997).
2. [We are the Treasury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABpGUHL1aTI&t=417s). Brown is now Chancellor.
3. [The New Labour Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eVel7gf90GcLAoXSaokzqPVOUrvqbIe)
4. On Gordon Brown: 
> "I found him odd at points, to be sure: the introspection, the intensity, finding him in his flat in Edinburgh on a Saturday morning in his suit trousers and white shirt, surrounded by a veritable avalanche of papers, but certainly, back then, it seemed an endearing eccentricity. He could be kind, generous, concerned, and often not just funny but with a rapier wit" *Tony Blair*, [My Journey](https://www.amazon.in/Journey-Tony-Blair/dp/0099525097) (2011).
