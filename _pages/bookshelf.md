I would *much* prefer that this page didn't exist, and that [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) just worked instead. However, Goodreads insists on logging me out every three or four minutes, making browsing impossible. This is apparently a problem they are working on fixing. Until then, I'm going to start cataloguing my reading anyway.
