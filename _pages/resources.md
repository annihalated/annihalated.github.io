Public policy in India is notoriously short on legible research guides. This is worth fixing. This is a self-built curriculum that I'm simultaneously building and working on completing.
* [Government](/government) is an in-progress project where I try to map the Government of India, and try to understand the entire system as a whole. My approach, for the moment, is modelled after the only way to eat an elephant. I don't imagine I will ever complete this, or that this will be useful. Instead, I'm going to try to use this ambitious goal to slowly make sense of institutional structures and decisionmaking.
