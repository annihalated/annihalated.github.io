* "Much meaningful activity is prevented by the aversive aura around brief awkward conversations like these. And even making simple changes in your environment comes with a small moment of humiliation. Hiring a personal trainer, if you have the money to do that, means confronting the fact that you need an appreciative audience for your muscle growth. Installing Cold Turkey to limit your time on Twitter requires admitting to yourself that you’re not in control, that thousands of years of evolution have not prepared you for Jack Dorsey’s mind manipulation techniques." ~ *Sasha Chapin*, [Self-Improvement Is, Generally, a Lie](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/self-improvement-is-generally-a-lie)
